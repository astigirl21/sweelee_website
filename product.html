            <h3>Electric Guitar ($1,579)</h3>
            <p>The Noventa Stratocaster® is an authoritative tone machine – featuring Noventa single-coil pickups, master volume and tone controls, and a hardtail Strat bridge – its striking good looks are matched by the midrange bite, crisp highs and smooth lows of the Noventa pickups. The dynamic range of these pickups offers a wide array of versatile and potent tones – suitable for everything from hard rock to jazz and anything in-between. A Modern “C” neck with 21 medium jumbo frets and 9.5” radius fingerboard delivers a smooth blend of modern and vintage playability that is distinctly Fender.</p>

            <h3>Amplifier ($1,499)</h3>
            <p>The PRS Archon is a commanding 2-channel amp with versatile overdriven tones and sparkling clean with plenty of headroom. Designed with five gain stages before the master volume, the Archon’s lead channel is voiced to cover everything from Classic Rock to Metal with full, lush distortion. The clean channel provides rich tones that retain clarity even at high volume, and there is ample headroom, creating an excellent platform for pedals. The Archon has a remarkably responsive tone with incredible note separation, whether you’re playing on the clean channel or chugging on the lead.</p>

It can live anywhere in your chain: hit it with your favorite overdrive or push it into another crazy distortion.</p>
