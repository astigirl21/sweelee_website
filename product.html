		<p>The Noventa Stratocaster® is an authoritative tone machine – featuring Noventa single-coil pickups, master volume and tone controls, and a hardtail Strat bridge – its striking good looks are matched by the midrange bite, crisp highs and smooth lows of the Noventa pickups. The dynamic range of these pickups offers a wide array of versatile and potent tones – suitable for everything from hard rock to jazz and anything in-between. A Modern “C” neck with 21 medium jumbo frets and 9.5” radius fingerboard delivers a smooth blend of modern and vintage playability that is distinctly Fender.</p>
